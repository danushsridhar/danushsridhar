      <h2 class="heading-2"> Bangalore Palace</h2>
      <p>An epitome of great architecture and beauty, The Majestic Bangalore Palace preserves in it the spice of old regal opulence. Currently the central attraction in Bangalore, the palace was built in the year 1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's
        British
        Guardians bought the original property in 1873 from the principal of Bangalore Central High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds. The palace is extraordinarily vast and spread across 45,000 square feet. A mixture of Tudor and Scottish Gothic
        architecture have resulted into the grand palace that we see today.The wooden structure of the palace along with the beautiful carvings both inside and outside showcases the royal culture in different ways.<br><br>
        Apart from being a major tourist destination, the palace is a host to different cultural events, rock shows, and marriages. As per beliefs, King Chamarajendra Wadiyar drew his inspiration for building the palace from the Windsor Castle of
        London. The granite seats decorated with fluorescent blue ceramic tiles on the ground floor, a fairy tale Ballroom, the famous painter Raja Ravi Varma's paintings, vine-covered walls, and the Durbar Hall on the first floor come together to
        form
        the prepossessing Bangalore Palace. <br><br>
        A visit to the palace gives you a chance to witness the elegant and lavish splendour of one of the most powerful dynasties of South India. An audio tape is available inside the Palace, both in Hindi and English, to help the people having
        language issues, understand its history better.<br>

      <h2 class="heading-2"> Bannerghatta National Park</h2>
      <p>Located 22 km away from Bangalore, the Bannerghatta National Park is a sanctuary for a large variety of flora and fauna. Spread over a massive area of around 104.27 sq. km, this national park was established in the year 1971. The park itself
        has a number of establishments within its confines, which includes the country's first butterfly park as well.<br><br>
        Other attractions here are ten Reserve Forests of Anekal Range of the Bangalore Forest Division, an aquarium, a zoo, Children's park, Crocodile Farm, Snake Park and Prehistoric Animals' Park. What's more, you can get up close and personal
        with
        the wondrous wildlife here by the means of a jungle safari, which is a popular activity to pursue here. The best part about Bannerghatta National Park is the small well-defined zones for animals that almost guarantees that you will spot the
        animals. People go in caged vehicles (buses/safari).<br></p>

      <p>One of the busiest shopping areas and biggest commercial centres in Bangalore, Brigade Road has earned fame fairly. It is also the road connecting Residency Road and M.G Road in the city. One interesting fact about this junction is that―in a

        flagships in Brigade Road Bangalore, while Fifth Avenue, Mota Royal Arcade and Eva mall at Residency Road house an array of different brands and stay open till later in the evening. The street stalls are piled high with unbranded shoes,
